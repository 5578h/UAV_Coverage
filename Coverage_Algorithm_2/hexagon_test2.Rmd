## Find Path based on Q table

```{r}
path = c()
state = START
Q[Q == 0] <- 1000
while (length(path) < V)
{
  pre_state = state
  path = c(path, state)   # append the state
  state = match((min(Q[state,])), Q[state,])   # argmin Q(S, )
  Q[pre_state, ] = 1000     # clear the column and row of the appended state 
  Q[, pre_state] = 1000     # by giving a large number
}

```
