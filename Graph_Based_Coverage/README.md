# Q learning with Graph-based State Representations

#### [Graph class](https://github.com/zcczhang/UAV_Coverage/blob/master/Graph_Based_Coverage/Graph.py): graph of the environment including generating the adjacency matrix

#### [NMDP reinforcement learning algorithm](https://github.com/zcczhang/UAV_Coverage/blob/master/Graph_Based_Coverage/rl_NMDP.py):

#### [MDP reinforcement learning algorithm](https://github.com/zcczhang/UAV_Coverage/blob/master/Graph_Based_Coverage/rl_MDP.py): Implement the graph representation at the [tabular Q learning](https://github.com/zcczhang/UAV_Coverage/tree/master/Grid%20World)

#### [Algorithm *Lite*](https://github.com/zcczhang/UAV_Coverage/tree/master/Graph_Based_Coverage/graph_coverage_Lite(R)) and tests in R:
